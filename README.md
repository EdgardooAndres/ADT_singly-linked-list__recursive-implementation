# Data-Lab3
In this activity, we will work with a recursive implementation of the IndexList ADT based on singly linked list. The implementation will be direct: not depending on another object of type LinkedList as was used in one of the previous lab sessions. We shall discuss some issues that are relevant in deriving a recursive solution for each operation to be implemented, as specified in the IndexList interface. Be aware that this way of thinking is useful for many other cases regarding operations on more complex data structures that shall be studied in the course. The class to implement is  SLRIndexList .
